            <h1>Welcome to Gull Dam Brewing</h1>
            <h6>Once upon a time, there was a man named Mark    and a woman named Barb.  They shared a fondness for sampling all sorts of craft beers.  You could say something was “brewing” even before they discovered they had a common interest in making their own beer.
</p>So Mark and his fiancée Barb decided to home brew a batch of beer.  They gathered lots of information on brewing beer, borrowed all the brewing equipment from a friend and began making their first batch of beer.  Barb suggested it should, ahem, be a blonde, but they settled on an amber ale.  They cooked the grains, simmered the malt and hops, cooled the sealed pot outside in <br>a snow bank, transferred the brew into a bucket, added the yeast, sealed the lid and let the brew ferment in Barb’s basement.
        </p>He and Barb started brewing their second batch of home brewed beer – a cream ale. Always the entrepreneur, Mark sensed a business opportunity.  With all of the microbreweries starting up across the country, and especially in Minnesota, he and Barb decided to jump on the <br>proverbial bandwagon (or beerwagon) <br>and create their own.</h6>
